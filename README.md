# Power Calculations and Experiment Planning

## Project Description

This project focuses on power calculations and experiment planning for a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) named Bandhan, based in West Bengal, India. Bandhan is planning to roll out a program that provides livestock, cash, and basic training to households in extreme poverty. The goal is to demonstrate the value of cash and asset transfers through a randomized experiment, collecting data on both control and treatment households. This project involves estimating the number of households to enroll in the program to ensure statistically significant results.

## Objectives

- Develop an understanding of power calculations and their importance in experiment planning.
- Estimate the sample size required for a randomized experiment to detect meaningful effects.
- Validate the power calculations using retrospective data from the actual program.

## The Context

Development economics posits that the poor may be trapped in poverty due to their initial conditions. This concept, known as the poverty trap, suggests that a one-time capital grant could help households escape poverty. The "Targeting the Ultra Poor" (TUP) intervention, pioneered by BRAC in Bangladesh, employs a multifaceted approach offering asset transfers, consumption support, savings, and training to unlock this poverty trap.

In 2007, Bandhan initiated a pilot program in West Bengal to provide direct, unconditional transfers of productive livestock and a stipend to the poorest households in selected villages. Eligible households were identified based on a range of criteria, and the average eligible household was estimated to have a consumption level of about $1.35 per capita per day in 2018 US Dollars (PPP).

The program targeted twice as many households as it could support, randomly selecting half to receive the intervention and the other half to act as controls. Treated households received assets such as cows and goats. The program's impact was measured in terms of per capita household expenditures in 2018 US Dollars (PPP).

## Methodology

### Data Source

The data used in this project comes from the actual program conducted by Bandhan in 2007, with follow-up data collection in 2010, 2017, and 2020. The focus is on per capita household expenditures in 2018 US Dollars (PPP).

### Power Calculations

The project involves calculating the statistical power of the study based on different sample sizes. Power calculations help determine the likelihood of detecting a true effect, given the sample size and effect size.

### Exercises

1. **Exercise 9: Actual Treatment Effect**
   - The observed treatment effect three years after asset transfers was $6.15 per capita monthly expenditures.
   - This underscores the positive impact of the intervention on the economic well-being of participating households.

2. **Exercise 10: Power Calculation for Original Sample Size**
   - The actual study design and sample size resulted in a high statistical power of approximately 0.9609.
   - This indicates a strong probability (over 96%) of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect when an actual effect exists.

3. **Exercise 11: Hypothetical Reduced Sample Size**
   - Reducing the sample size to 200 households per arm lowered the statistical power to around 0.7155.
   - The proportion of simulations rejecting the null hypothesis at an alpha of 0.05 decreased to approximately 53.82%.

4. **Exercise 14: Increased Sample Size**
   - Increasing the sample size to 300 households per arm improved the statistical power to around 0.873.
   - A higher proportion of cases (71.2%) would reject the null hypothesis of no effect, illustrating the relationship between sample size and statistical power.

## Results

### Power Calculation Insights

- **Impact of Sample Size on Power:** As the sample size increases, the power to detect a true effect also increases, enhancing the study's ability to identify meaningful differences.
- **Statistical Power and Study Design:** The original study's design with a high power of 0.9609 highlights the effectiveness of the sample size in detecting the intervention's impact.
- **Sample Size and Uncertainty:** Smaller sample sizes result in lower statistical power, increasing uncertainty in the study's findings.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we have demonstrated the importance of power calculations in experiment planning. By estimating the required sample size and understanding the relationship between sample size and statistical power, we ensure that the study is well-equipped to detect meaningful effects. The retrospective comparison with actual program data validates the power calculations and provides valuable insights for future experimental designs.
